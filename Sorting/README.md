# Sorting Algorithms

This directory holds sorting algorithms of various complexity (and seriousness).  These algorithms take an unordered list of data as input and return an ordered list of the same data.  The ordered list returned is necessarily a permutation of the input list.

Various orderings may be used depending on the data set passed in, like numerical order for numbers, lexicographical order for alphanumeric strings, or ranking for cards for example.  These orderings may also have a desired direction (ascending or descending), like from low numbers to higher numbers, or vice versa as an example.
