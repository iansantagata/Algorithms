# Algorithms

The purpose of this repository is to store various implementations of different types of algorithms, of varying goals and complexity.

Each implemented algorithm should be:
- Clear and concise
- Independently executable
- Rigorously tested
- Well documented
- Categorized with similar algorithms

In short, each algorithm should be implemented in a straight-forward enough way that a novice programmer could understand, replicate, and execute each algorithm as needed.
