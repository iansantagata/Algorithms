# Algorithms

The purpose of this repository is to store various implementations of different types of algorithms, of varying goals and complexity.

Each implemented algorithm should be:
- Clear and concise
- Independently executable
- Rigorously tested
- Well documented
- Categorized with similar algorithms

In short, each algorithm should be implemented in a straight-forward enough way that a novice programmer could understand, replicate, and execute each algorithm as needed.

## Quick Start

To get started with running, analyzing, and testing the code in this repository:

1. Run `git clone` on this repository to get the code locally
2. Run `source ./tools/bootstrap.sh` from the repository root to install everything you need and start up a virtual environment
3. Run any algorithm, test, or analysis you like on the code!
